# React-Multiverse

## Welcome to the react multiverse!

There is not only one universe, but many!  What we have only just discovered is that they all exist inside a react component!

## MIND BLOWN!

You are a space ship searching for liveable planets across each multiverse!  Use the arrowkeys to move, and fly off screen to enter a new universe.  Each universe that contains ![Earth](./client/public/Earth.png) is a liveable universe with a liveable planet!  Enjoy and save your race, or explore, or something (we don't know why you are doing this.)
